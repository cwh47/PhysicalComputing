#Digi Hourglass

I made the digital hour glass by following the instructions in the book for putting it together and writing the code. However, I was a little too impatient to wait for an hour to watch all 6 lights turn on. To speed things up a bit, I changed the **long variable** to 600 so that every 600 miliseconds, a bulb would illuminate.
