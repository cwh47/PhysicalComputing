#Digi Hourglass

I made the digital hour glass by following the instructions in the book for putting it together and writing the code. However, I was a little too impatient to wait for an hour to watch all 6 lights turn on. To speed things up a bit, I changed the **long variable** to 600 so that every 600 miliseconds, a bulb would illuminate. 

###Check out a gif of the hourglass here:

###Here's the code
const int switchPin = 8;
unsigned long previousTime = 0;
int switchState = 0;
int prevSwitchState = 0;
int led = 2;
long interval = 600;

void setup() {

  for (int x = 2; x < 8; x++) {
    pinMode(x, OUTPUT);
  }

  pinMode(switchPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {

  unsigned long currentTime = millis();

  if (currentTime - previousTime > interval) {
    previousTime = currentTime;
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
    led++;
    if (led == 7) {
    }
  }
  switchState = digitalRead(switchPin);
  if (switchState != prevSwitchState) {
    for (int x = 2; x < 8; x++) {
      digitalWrite(x, LOW);
    }
    led = 2;
    previousTime = currentTime;
  }
  prevSwitchState = switchState;
}
