#Color Lamp & Loveometer

######I created the two projects by following the instructions in the arduino book for setting up the circuit and writing the code. 

For the Loveometer, there was a lot of trial and error in  terms of getting the **baselineTemp variable** right. I had to play around with testing my body temperature with the sensors and reading the measurements in the console. I also had to fiddle with the code that controlled the 2nd and 3rd leds.
