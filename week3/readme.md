 #:space_invader: The Matrix is scary! :space_invader:

#####Just kidding, no it's not. You just need to choose the right pill.

I created an interface for a digital matrix-destiny-pill-choosing-
assistant (yay?).

I did this by creating a circuit in parallel. I followed the instructions 
for an example in the Arduino Project Book but adapted it to work with controlling
2 different LEDs with 2 separate switches. 

I then coded it so that when the program runs, it will check if either switch 1 or
switch 2 is pressed. If switch 1 is not pressed, the blue LED is turned off. 
If it is pressed, the blue LED turns on (while pressed). If switch 2 is not pressed,
the red LED is turned off. If switch 2 is pressed, the red LED turns on (while pressed).

Woot Matrix!
