# Final Project: Color Sensor-o-meter

For my final project, I wanted to create something that had useful purpose. 

We live in a society that is stuck on designing for the majority, not realizing that there is often a group of people who will not have the luxury of using a product or service because of its exclusive nature. I wanted to make something that would inspire others to think about design in terms of form and function, but also in terms of inlcusivity. This is an attempt to work toward a stance that designs for all from the start, rather than designing for some then trying to adjust for all.

Something that many people take for granted is the luxuries provided by having even "okay" vision. Those who are blind or visually impaired struggle with identifying color. I decided to make a device that would identify color using a sensor, transfer the data to a servo, and point to a color on a wheel marked with braille. Ideally, the device would have implemented voice output instead of using a servo (not everyone with a visual impairment reads braille), but I thought I'd start simple.
