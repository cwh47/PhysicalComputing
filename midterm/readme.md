###Project idea 1

For my midterm, I browsed around hackster.io for some inspiration and really liked a project called the holiday shadow theater (https://www.hackster.io/Lucas_Ainsworth/holiday-shadow-theater-505ba3?ref=channel&ref_id=424_trending___&offset=226). Using paper cutouts, an arduino, LED strips, and some programming, you can achieve a shadow scene...like digital-age shadow puppets!

I'd like to create something similar that has interchangable scenery. I would design and create different cutout boards that could be inserted into/onto the box. It could be controlled either by phone, by switch, or be put on a timer to illuminate from a x time to x time. I'm a big Miyazaki fan so I was thinking maybe different scenes from movies like Spirited Away, Totoro, and Castle in the Sky. A modification for this project could be done by 3D printing components of the project like the box, the boards, etc.
