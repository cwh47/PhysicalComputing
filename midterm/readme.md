###Project idea 1

For my midterm, I browsed around hackster.io for some inspiration and really liked a project called the holiday shadow theater (https://www.hackster.io/Lucas_Ainsworth/holiday-shadow-theater-505ba3?ref=channel&ref_id=424_trending___&offset=226). Using paper cutouts, an arduino, LED strips, and some programming, you can achieve a shadow scene...like digital-age shadow puppets!

I'd like to create something similar that has interchangable scenery. I would design and create different cutout boards that could be inserted into/onto the box. It could be controlled either by phone, by switch, or be put on a timer to illuminate from a x time to x time. I'm a big Miyazaki fan so I was thinking maybe different scenes from movies like Spirited Away, Totoro, and Castle in the Sky. A modification for this project could be done by 3D printing components of the project like the box, the boards, etc. 

#####Project 1 code plan

######Interaction
User chooses board and attaches it to box. User presses switch to turn on system.

######Components
* Different color LEDs
* Foam board or cardboard (box)
* Poster board (scenery cutouts)
* Switch

######Pseudocode
* Turn on lights
* Stay on for 1 hours
* Turn off 


###Project idea 2

For my second idea I was thinking of making a lamp shaped like a character or object that changed color based on the temperature of the room. Someone recently bought this lamp (https://www.amazon.com/Mystery-Portable-Rechargeable-Breathing-Sensitive/dp/B01E8M302U) as joke gift for my fiance (it didn't work though, meh). I'm trying to think of what I could use as the "housing" for the lamp...ideas include something that is 3D printed, a canister with hole cutouts (e.g. star projections), or a DIY lamp apparatus.

#####Project 2 code plan

######Interaction
User presses switch to turn on, cycle through colors, and turn off.

######Components
* Different color LEDs
* Lamp housing
* Switch

######Pseudocode
* Switch on
* Switch off
